This ordinance, which passed unanimously out of committee, establishes the Seattle Renters Commission to represent the interests of renters who live in Seattle.

The purpose of the commission is to advise the Mayor and City Council on Public Policy matters of importance to renters and especially all of our renter protection, landlord protection laws and others. But also beyond that to what renters care about citywide. And that is things like transit. Rotation, public health and safety parks and open space education and other topics that renters in our city engage on. The commission will be comprised of 15 members, six appointed by the mayor, six appointed by the city council, two appointed by the commission and the final member young adult appointed through the Get Engaged program, which is a city YMCA program. The Commission will be staffed through the Department of Neighborhoods and assuming this passes and the mayor signs it, which I believe he will, outreach about the commission and applications for individuals who would like to be appointed to the commission will begin in April. We hope that we can complete that in May or early June and the Commission can start meeting early this summer. There's been a lot of talk about the renter's commissioner and whether we need the renters commissioner or don't need the renters commission. Some have suggested that this is an anti landlord move. That's certainly not the case. We just want to give renters a formal voice here at City Hall. And as I said last week in discussing this, renters need landlords and landlords need renters.

And. Whereas, the event is co-produced by the downtown Alameda Business Association, Daubert, its board of Directors and member businesses and strum productions to raise funds to keep downtown Alameda clean, green and safe. And. Whereas, the event provides an opportunity for thousands of visitors and residents to discover our vibrant downtown districts, celebrate the creativity of Northern California artisans and sample locally crafted beer, wine and food. And. Whereas, more than 200 bands have performed live over the years and a local stage was added in 2018 to highlight Alameda based performers. And.

Whereas, to celebrate the 35th anniversary Dover will hold, will host a free showing of every poster from the fair's 35 year history collection at the Auto Body Fine Art Gallery on Park Street from July 17 to 28, 2019.

And. Whereas, the event is co-produced by the downtown Alameda Business Association, Daubert, its board of Directors and member businesses and strum productions to raise funds to keep downtown Alameda clean, green and safe. And. Whereas, the event provides an opportunity for thousands of visitors and residents to discover our vibrant downtown districts, celebrate the creativity of Northern California artisans and sample locally crafted beer, wine and food.

Alameda Art and Wine Fair was held 35 years ago on August three and four in 1984. And. Whereas, the event continues to be the largest street festival on the island, staffed by 200 volunteers each year, a total of 7000 volunteers and over 14000 hours of service over the past 35 years. And. Whereas, the event is co-produced by the downtown Alameda Business Association, Daubert, its board of Directors and member businesses and strum productions to raise funds to keep downtown Alameda clean, green and safe. And. Whereas, the event provides an opportunity for thousands of visitors and residents to discover our vibrant downtown districts, celebrate the creativity of Northern California artisans and sample locally crafted beer, wine and food. And. Whereas, more than 200 bands have performed live over the years and a local stage was added in 2018 to highlight Alameda based performers. And.

Whereas, to celebrate the 35th anniversary Dover will hold, will host a free showing of every poster from the fair's 35 year history collection at the Auto Body Fine Art Gallery on Park Street from July 17 to 28, 2019.

Whereas, the event continues to be the largest street festival on the island, staffed by 200 volunteers each year, a total of 7000 volunteers and over 14000 hours of service over the past 35 years. And. Whereas, the event is co-produced by the downtown Alameda Business Association, Daubert, its board of Directors and member businesses and strum productions to raise funds to keep downtown Alameda clean, green and safe. And. Whereas, the event provides an opportunity for thousands of visitors and residents to discover our vibrant downtown districts, celebrate the creativity of Northern California artisans and sample locally crafted beer, wine and food. And. Whereas, more than 200 bands have performed live over the years and a local stage was added in 2018 to highlight Alameda based performers. And. WHEREAS, the event offers family friendly entertainment, including a Ferris wheel, bungee jump, water balls, kiddy train and puppet show. And. Whereas, to celebrate the 35th anniversary Dover will hold, will host a free showing of every poster from the fair's 35 year history collection at the Auto Body Fine Art Gallery on Park Street from July 17 to 28, 2019. So now, therefore, be it resolved that I, Marilyn, as the Ashcroft mayor of the city of Alameda, do hereby proclaim July 27 and 28 as the Art and Wine Fair's 35th anniversary in the city of Alameda and congratulate the downtown Alameda Business Association on their continued success and invite Alameda INS and visitors to enjoy the 2019 Art and Wine Fair. And with that, Ms.. Maccabee, would you like to say a few words?", "Speaker 3: Yes, thank you. Madam Mayor, councilmembers and city staff. Thank you for acknowledging that. Acknowledging the 35th anniversary of the art and wine fair in historic downtown Alameda, the downtown Alameda Business Association Board of Directors, Board, committee staff and our event partner Equestrian Productions are most grateful for the years of support that this council and the many that have gone before have given. We are equally thankful for the support of the dedicated city staff, including but not limited to our police and fire departments. Permits and planning, public works, economic development as each have assisted us with the details necessary to pull off this major event. Many of you have volunteered and your time and your talents and you've stood by local residents that have also helped our loyal sponsors and community partners that have helped to fund this undertaking. Share this honor with our association. We'd like to acknowledge our downtown businesses who roll out the welcome mat for tens of thousands of people every time we put this event on.

Alameda Art and Wine Fair was held 35 years ago on August three and four in 1984. And.

And. Whereas, the event is co-produced by the downtown Alameda Business Association, Daubert, its board of Directors and member businesses and strum productions to raise funds to keep downtown Alameda clean, green and safe. And. Whereas, the event provides an opportunity for thousands of visitors and residents to discover our vibrant downtown districts, celebrate the creativity of Northern California artisans and sample locally crafted beer, wine and food. And. Whereas, more than 200 bands have performed live over the years and a local stage was added in 2018 to highlight Alameda based performers. And. WHEREAS, the event offers family friendly entertainment, including a Ferris wheel, bungee jump, water balls, kiddy train and puppet show. And. Whereas, to celebrate the 35th anniversary Dover will hold, will host a free showing of every poster from the fair's 35 year history collection at the Auto Body Fine Art Gallery on Park Street from July 17 to 28, 2019. So now, therefore, be it resolved that I, Marilyn, as the Ashcroft mayor of the city of Alameda, do hereby proclaim July 27 and 28 as the Art and Wine Fair's 35th anniversary in the city of Alameda and congratulate the downtown Alameda Business Association on their continued success and invite Alameda INS and visitors to enjoy the 2019 Art and Wine Fair.

Janet Maccabee, executive director of downtown Alameda Business Association. So come on now. Here's your proclamation. Where is the first? Alameda Art and Wine Fair was held 35 years ago on August three and four in 1984. And. Whereas, the event continues to be the largest street festival on the island, staffed by 200 volunteers each year, a total of 7000 volunteers and over 14000 hours of service over the past 35 years. And. Whereas, the event is co-produced by the downtown Alameda Business Association, Daubert, its board of Directors and member businesses and strum productions to raise funds to keep downtown Alameda clean, green and safe. And. Whereas, the event provides an opportunity for thousands of visitors and residents to discover our vibrant downtown districts, celebrate the creativity of Northern California artisans and sample locally crafted beer, wine and food. And. Whereas, more than 200 bands have performed live over the years and a local stage was added in 2018 to highlight Alameda based performers. And. WHEREAS, the event offers family friendly entertainment, including a Ferris wheel, bungee jump, water balls, kiddy train and puppet show. And. Whereas, to celebrate the 35th anniversary Dover will hold, will host a free showing of every poster from the fair's 35 year history collection at the Auto Body Fine Art Gallery on Park Street from July 17 to 28, 2019. So now, therefore, be it resolved that I, Marilyn, as the Ashcroft mayor of the city of Alameda, do hereby proclaim July 27 and 28 as the Art and Wine Fair's 35th anniversary in the city of Alameda and congratulate the downtown Alameda Business Association on their continued success and invite Alameda INS and visitors to enjoy the 2019 Art and Wine Fair.

Councilmember Andrews This is a project that's very near and dear to Councilmember Austin's heart. And I'm going to turn it over to our sustainability manager, Larry Rich, to tell us what's happening. Thank you, Mr. West. Good evening, Mayor, and members of the Council. One of the things that we do in the Office of Sustainability is always looking for grant opportunities to pursue either for funding or, in this case, technical assistance. And so and this particular grant opportunity, the organization Global Green reached out to us and invited us to apply for a program that they're doing that's called the Sustainable Neighborhood Assessment. This is the third year of their program. In the past two years, they've selected in each of the years, seven or eight other cities around the country. This year they were looking for another seven or eight cities. And so Long Beach applied. We in working with the Development Services Department and looking into previous planning efforts, we selected a neighborhood in in the eighth District in the vicinity of Market Street and the Virginia Village right there at Market and Language Boulevard. And so what this is all about is we previously interacted with Global Green to create our green building policy for both municipal development and private development. And in that policy, we use a tool called the Lead Checklist LEED being leadership in energy and environmental design. So at this point in the city of Long Beach, we've got more than 30 LEED certified buildings, some of which are city owned facilities such as Fire Station 12 or the gas and oil building that was recently completed. There's a there's a different product that we're not as familiar with that's called LEED for Neighborhood Development. So over the course of this grant technical assistance, we will be doing a assessment of this neighborhood around Market Street with a mind to what sort of strengths the neighborhood has, what sort of green opportunities exist. And we will be provided with a report and assessment at the end of the process that will make recommendations to the city about how it might proceed with development projects in that neighborhood to introduce green elements such as pedestrian friendliness, stormwater improvements, open space linkages and so on. The technical assistance involves an intensive three day site visit by the Global Green Experts, where we'll do. A city team will be assembled to work with the Global Green team. We'll do a walk the neighborhood to get a feel for what's going on, on the ground, review the existing plans that have been completed for the area, run through the the lead for neighborhood development checklist to review opportunities there, hold a couple or a stakeholder meeting and also a an evening community input meeting and then tie all that information together in what I've seen done for the other cities that have completed this process, a 20 to 25 page report that then comes back to the city and it'll be on us to implement recommendations that are made in that report. So that's a kind of a quick overview of what we're talking about for this neighborhood. We're excited in the Office of Sustainability because, as I said, we don't necessarily have experience with the lead for neighborhood development tool. So it'll be a good learning experience for city staff and hopefully we'll pick up some things through this process that will be applicable to neighborhoods across the city. That's the end of my report and I'm ready for any questions.", "Speaker 5: Well, I'll just give you a comment and say, you know, I'm looking forward to this. I know many of our residents are looking forward to it. And as you say, stakeholders as well in the area. I think this project will this assessment will help tie in Virginia Village. Which has already seen significant city investment. On that with the Forest Wetlands Project is coming to Earth as well. And so Market Street is a is a is a priority for this.

And I'm going to turn it over to our sustainability manager, Larry Rich, to tell us what's happening. Thank you, Mr. West. Good evening, Mayor, and members of the Council. One of the things that we do in the Office of Sustainability is always looking for grant opportunities to pursue either for funding or, in this case, technical assistance. And so and this particular grant opportunity, the organization Global Green reached out to us and invited us to apply for a program that they're doing that's called the Sustainable Neighborhood Assessment. This is the third year of their program. In the past two years, they've selected in each of the years, seven or eight other cities around the country. This year they were looking for another seven or eight cities. And so Long Beach applied. We in working with the Development Services Department and looking into previous planning efforts, we selected a neighborhood in in the eighth District in the vicinity of Market Street and the Virginia Village right there at Market and Language Boulevard. And so what this is all about is we previously interacted with Global Green to create our green building policy for both municipal development and private development. And in that policy, we use a tool called the Lead Checklist LEED being leadership in energy and environmental design. So at this point in the city of Long Beach, we've got more than 30 LEED certified buildings, some of which are city owned facilities such as Fire Station 12 or the gas and oil building that was recently completed. There's a there's a different product that we're not as familiar with that's called LEED for Neighborhood Development. So over the course of this grant technical assistance, we will be doing a assessment of this neighborhood around Market Street with a mind to what sort of strengths the neighborhood has, what sort of green opportunities exist. And we will be provided with a report and assessment at the end of the process that will make recommendations to the city about how it might proceed with development projects in that neighborhood to introduce green elements such as pedestrian friendliness, stormwater improvements, open space linkages and so on. The technical assistance involves an intensive three day site visit by the Global Green Experts, where we'll do. A city team will be assembled to work with the Global Green team. We'll do a walk the neighborhood to get a feel for what's going on, on the ground, review the existing plans that have been completed for the area, run through the the lead for neighborhood development checklist to review opportunities there, hold a couple or a stakeholder meeting and also a an evening community input meeting and then tie all that information together in what I've seen done for the other cities that have completed this process, a 20 to 25 page report that then comes back to the city and it'll be on us to implement recommendations that are made in that report. So that's a kind of a quick overview of what we're talking about for this neighborhood. We're excited in the Office of Sustainability because, as I said, we don't necessarily have experience with the lead for neighborhood development tool. So it'll be a good learning experience for city staff and hopefully we'll pick up some things through this process that will be applicable to neighborhoods across the city. That's the end of my report and I'm ready for any questions.", "Speaker 5: Well, I'll just give you a comment and say, you know, I'm looking forward to this.

One of the things that we do in the Office of Sustainability is always looking for grant opportunities to pursue either for funding or, in this case, technical assistance. And so and this particular grant opportunity, the organization Global Green reached out to us and invited us to apply for a program that they're doing that's called the Sustainable Neighborhood Assessment. This is the third year of their program. In the past two years, they've selected in each of the years, seven or eight other cities around the country. This year they were looking for another seven or eight cities. And so Long Beach applied. We in working with the Development Services Department and looking into previous planning efforts, we selected a neighborhood in in the eighth District in the vicinity of Market Street and the Virginia Village right there at Market and Language Boulevard. And so what this is all about is we previously interacted with Global Green to create our green building policy for both municipal development and private development. And in that policy, we use a tool called the Lead Checklist LEED being leadership in energy and environmental design. So at this point in the city of Long Beach, we've got more than 30 LEED certified buildings, some of which are city owned facilities such as Fire Station 12 or the gas and oil building that was recently completed. There's a there's a different product that we're not as familiar with that's called LEED for Neighborhood Development. So over the course of this grant technical assistance, we will be doing a assessment of this neighborhood around Market Street with a mind to what sort of strengths the neighborhood has, what sort of green opportunities exist. And we will be provided with a report and assessment at the end of the process that will make recommendations to the city about how it might proceed with development projects in that neighborhood to introduce green elements such as pedestrian friendliness, stormwater improvements, open space linkages and so on. The technical assistance involves an intensive three day site visit by the Global Green Experts, where we'll do. A city team will be assembled to work with the Global Green team. We'll do a walk the neighborhood to get a feel for what's going on, on the ground, review the existing plans that have been completed for the area, run through the the lead for neighborhood development checklist to review opportunities there, hold a couple or a stakeholder meeting and also a an evening community input meeting and then tie all that information together in what I've seen done for the other cities that have completed this process, a 20 to 25 page report that then comes back to the city and it'll be on us to implement recommendations that are made in that report. So that's a kind of a quick overview of what we're talking about for this neighborhood.

And so and this particular grant opportunity, the organization Global Green reached out to us and invited us to apply for a program that they're doing that's called the Sustainable Neighborhood Assessment. This is the third year of their program. In the past two years, they've selected in each of the years, seven or eight other cities around the country. This year they were looking for another seven or eight cities. And so Long Beach applied. We in working with the Development Services Department and looking into previous planning efforts, we selected a neighborhood in in the eighth District in the vicinity of Market Street and the Virginia Village right there at Market and Language Boulevard. And so what this is all about is we previously interacted with Global Green to create our green building policy for both municipal development and private development. And in that policy, we use a tool called the Lead Checklist LEED being leadership in energy and environmental design. So at this point in the city of Long Beach, we've got more than 30 LEED certified buildings, some of which are city owned facilities such as Fire Station 12 or the gas and oil building that was recently completed. There's a there's a different product that we're not as familiar with that's called LEED for Neighborhood Development. So over the course of this grant technical assistance, we will be doing a assessment of this neighborhood around Market Street with a mind to what sort of strengths the neighborhood has, what sort of green opportunities exist. And we will be provided with a report and assessment at the end of the process that will make recommendations to the city about how it might proceed with development projects in that neighborhood to introduce green elements such as pedestrian friendliness, stormwater improvements, open space linkages and so on. The technical assistance involves an intensive three day site visit by the Global Green Experts, where we'll do. A city team will be assembled to work with the Global Green team. We'll do a walk the neighborhood to get a feel for what's going on, on the ground, review the existing plans that have been completed for the area, run through the the lead for neighborhood development checklist to review opportunities there, hold a couple or a stakeholder meeting and also a an evening community input meeting and then tie all that information together in what I've seen done for the other cities that have completed this process, a 20 to 25 page report that then comes back to the city and it'll be on us to implement recommendations that are made in that report. So that's a kind of a quick overview of what we're talking about for this neighborhood. We're excited in the Office of Sustainability because, as I said, we don't necessarily have experience with the lead for neighborhood development tool. So it'll be a good learning experience for city staff and hopefully we'll pick up some things through this process that will be applicable to neighborhoods across the city.

This item is a public hearing to consider a resolution to modify the city's master fee schedule for development services by reducing selected entitlement fees and adopting new fees related to the mailing of public hearing notices. As you recall, on September 18th, 2018, the City Council adopted an ordinance that amended various sections of the zoning code related to conditional use permits, and it also. This action that the Council took at that time also updated the public notification requirements. Since then, our staff has evaluated the specific entitlement application fees, which currently include the cost for mailed public hearing notices. So of what we found from that analysis is that approximately $950 of the current application fees go toward the costs of producing and mailing these public notices. So adoption of this resolution would effectively unbundle the noticing fees from the application fee for most of the entitlement applications that we process. This resolution would also establish a tiered fee structure for mailing public notices going forward. The proposed fee reduction is $950 less than the current application fees and the new publication or the new public noticing fees range from $410 for the standard 300 foot noticing radius for Tier one. And this is explained in a little bit more detail in your staff report. But there's also a Tier two noticing four or 500 foot radius, and that is whenever a project is within 300 feet of a residential development and it goes up to Tier three, which is $950 for noticing whenever a project is 750 feet or greater from any application that addresses either a reduction of parking, shared parking or a project where there is a code requirement for some kind of distance buffering, like in a tattoo parlor as an example. So I just want to make sure that you're aware that this particular action will address mail notices, but it does not change any of the other standard notices that staff provides, and these include posting the notices in City Hall. We also post individual development sites with those large noticing posters. We also notice post notice on the city's website. We also notify city council offices as well as neighborhood organizations for all of the required public noticing for discretionary approvals. So I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of that. And we feel that the proposed resolution tonight balances the direction of the council to reduce the costs of the conditional use permit process. But we think that it also provides ample notification to the to the public for discretionary actions. So staff recommends that the city council adopt the proposed resolution to reduce the application fees and also to establish the new tiered fee schedule for public noticing.

This action that the Council took at that time also updated the public notification requirements. Since then, our staff has evaluated the specific entitlement application fees, which currently include the cost for mailed public hearing notices. So of what we found from that analysis is that approximately $950 of the current application fees go toward the costs of producing and mailing these public notices. So adoption of this resolution would effectively unbundle the noticing fees from the application fee for most of the entitlement applications that we process. This resolution would also establish a tiered fee structure for mailing public notices going forward. The proposed fee reduction is $950 less than the current application fees and the new publication or the new public noticing fees range from $410 for the standard 300 foot noticing radius for Tier one. And this is explained in a little bit more detail in your staff report. But there's also a Tier two noticing four or 500 foot radius, and that is whenever a project is within 300 feet of a residential development and it goes up to Tier three, which is $950 for noticing whenever a project is 750 feet or greater from any application that addresses either a reduction of parking, shared parking or a project where there is a code requirement for some kind of distance buffering, like in a tattoo parlor as an example. So I just want to make sure that you're aware that this particular action will address mail notices, but it does not change any of the other standard notices that staff provides, and these include posting the notices in City Hall. We also post individual development sites with those large noticing posters. We also notice post notice on the city's website. We also notify city council offices as well as neighborhood organizations for all of the required public noticing for discretionary approvals. So I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of that. And we feel that the proposed resolution tonight balances the direction of the council to reduce the costs of the conditional use permit process. But we think that it also provides ample notification to the to the public for discretionary actions. So staff recommends that the city council adopt the proposed resolution to reduce the application fees and also to establish the new tiered fee schedule for public noticing.

This item is a public hearing to consider a resolution to modify the city's master fee schedule for development services by reducing selected entitlement fees and adopting new fees related to the mailing of public hearing notices. As you recall, on September 18th, 2018, the City Council adopted an ordinance that amended various sections of the zoning code related to conditional use permits, and it also. This action that the Council took at that time also updated the public notification requirements. Since then, our staff has evaluated the specific entitlement application fees, which currently include the cost for mailed public hearing notices. So of what we found from that analysis is that approximately $950 of the current application fees go toward the costs of producing and mailing these public notices. So adoption of this resolution would effectively unbundle the noticing fees from the application fee for most of the entitlement applications that we process. This resolution would also establish a tiered fee structure for mailing public notices going forward. The proposed fee reduction is $950 less than the current application fees and the new publication or the new public noticing fees range from $410 for the standard 300 foot noticing radius for Tier one. And this is explained in a little bit more detail in your staff report. But there's also a Tier two noticing four or 500 foot radius, and that is whenever a project is within 300 feet of a residential development and it goes up to Tier three, which is $950 for noticing whenever a project is 750 feet or greater from any application that addresses either a reduction of parking, shared parking or a project where there is a code requirement for some kind of distance buffering, like in a tattoo parlor as an example. So I just want to make sure that you're aware that this particular action will address mail notices, but it does not change any of the other standard notices that staff provides, and these include posting the notices in City Hall. We also post individual development sites with those large noticing posters. We also notice post notice on the city's website. We also notify city council offices as well as neighborhood organizations for all of the required public noticing for discretionary approvals.

This item is a public hearing to consider a resolution to modify the city's master fee schedule for development services by reducing selected entitlement fees and adopting new fees related to the mailing of public hearing notices. As you recall, on September 18th, 2018, the City Council adopted an ordinance that amended various sections of the zoning code related to conditional use permits, and it also. This action that the Council took at that time also updated the public notification requirements. Since then, our staff has evaluated the specific entitlement application fees, which currently include the cost for mailed public hearing notices. So of what we found from that analysis is that approximately $950 of the current application fees go toward the costs of producing and mailing these public notices. So adoption of this resolution would effectively unbundle the noticing fees from the application fee for most of the entitlement applications that we process. This resolution would also establish a tiered fee structure for mailing public notices going forward. The proposed fee reduction is $950 less than the current application fees and the new publication or the new public noticing fees range from $410 for the standard 300 foot noticing radius for Tier one. And this is explained in a little bit more detail in your staff report. But there's also a Tier two noticing four or 500 foot radius, and that is whenever a project is within 300 feet of a residential development and it goes up to Tier three, which is $950 for noticing whenever a project is 750 feet or greater from any application that addresses either a reduction of parking, shared parking or a project where there is a code requirement for some kind of distance buffering, like in a tattoo parlor as an example. So I just want to make sure that you're aware that this particular action will address mail notices, but it does not change any of the other standard notices that staff provides, and these include posting the notices in City Hall. We also post individual development sites with those large noticing posters. We also notice post notice on the city's website. We also notify city council offices as well as neighborhood organizations for all of the required public noticing for discretionary approvals. So I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of that. And we feel that the proposed resolution tonight balances the direction of the council to reduce the costs of the conditional use permit process.

Given the importance that SB one has provided for not only the city limits, but for the state as a whole, I think it's very important that we oppose this proposition because it would have a devastating effect on all the projects that we currently have going in the city alone, which because of SB one, and when you look at what's going on with the replacement bridge at the replacement Desmond Bridge, it would be a bridge going to nowhere if we didn't have the funds to finish that project. And we have as well some other projects in Long Beach, including the Long Beach Boulevard and Pacific Coast Highway and a lot of other projects that we have because of SB one.

I'd also like to just weigh in and say, I think it's important for us to to stand by what we've worked for as a council and support it for for several years. It was the Fix Our Roads kind of campaign through the League of California Cities, a lot of our legislative advocacy for infrastructure support and dollars for state highways, but also for local roads as well, that this these dollars actually will go a long way, if I'm not mistaken.

So with SB one, we add another eight for FY19.", "Speaker 7: About 11 for FY 20, and then adjusted to inflation every year thereafter.", "Speaker 8: So I think it's a the the, the gas tax that we have is a small price to pay for, for good infrastructure investing in our future. The impact would be obviously significant for our public works infrastructure budget. And if we didn't if we lost those dollars, we'd have to be made up elsewhere. We and that would be less dollars that we could actually put toward residential streets, which I think are so important to our residents.

And part of SB one separate of what we're getting annually this year is the entire reconstruction of PCH from our entrance point in Orange County, all the way through the city to our exit point in in western Long Beach.

One of the things that we do in the Office of Sustainability is always looking for grant opportunities to pursue either for funding or, in this case, technical assistance. And so and this particular grant opportunity, the organization Global Green reached out to us and invited us to apply for a program that they're doing that's called the Sustainable Neighborhood Assessment. This is the third year of their program. In the past two years, they've selected in each of the years, seven or eight other cities around the country. This year they were looking for another seven or eight cities. And so Long Beach applied. We in working with the Development Services Department and looking into previous planning efforts, we selected a neighborhood in in the eighth District in the vicinity of Market Street and the Virginia Village right there at Market and Language Boulevard. And so what this is all about is we previously interacted with Global Green to create our green building policy for both municipal development and private development. And in that policy, we use a tool called the Lead Checklist LEED being leadership in energy and environmental design. So at this point in the city of Long Beach, we've got more than 30 LEED certified buildings, some of which are city owned facilities such as Fire Station 12 or the gas and oil building that was recently completed. There's a there's a different product that we're not as familiar with that's called LEED for Neighborhood Development. So over the course of this grant technical assistance, we will be doing a assessment of this neighborhood around Market Street with a mind to what sort of strengths the neighborhood has, what sort of green opportunities exist. And we will be provided with a report and assessment at the end of the process that will make recommendations to the city about how it might proceed with development projects in that neighborhood to introduce green elements such as pedestrian friendliness, stormwater improvements, open space linkages and so on. The technical assistance involves an intensive three day site visit by the Global Green Experts, where we'll do. A city team will be assembled to work with the Global Green team. We'll do a walk the neighborhood to get a feel for what's going on, on the ground, review the existing plans that have been completed for the area, run through the the lead for neighborhood development checklist to review opportunities there, hold a couple or a stakeholder meeting and also a an evening community input meeting and then tie all that information together in what I've seen done for the other cities that have completed this process, a 20 to 25 page report that then comes back to the city and it'll be on us to implement recommendations that are made in that report. So that's a kind of a quick overview of what we're talking about for this neighborhood. We're excited in the Office of Sustainability because, as I said, we don't necessarily have experience with the lead for neighborhood development tool.

And we will be provided with a report and assessment at the end of the process that will make recommendations to the city about how it might proceed with development projects in that neighborhood to introduce green elements such as pedestrian friendliness, stormwater improvements, open space linkages and so on. The technical assistance involves an intensive three day site visit by the Global Green Experts, where we'll do. A city team will be assembled to work with the Global Green team. We'll do a walk the neighborhood to get a feel for what's going on, on the ground, review the existing plans that have been completed for the area, run through the the lead for neighborhood development checklist to review opportunities there, hold a couple or a stakeholder meeting and also a an evening community input meeting and then tie all that information together in what I've seen done for the other cities that have completed this process, a 20 to 25 page report that then comes back to the city and it'll be on us to implement recommendations that are made in that report. So that's a kind of a quick overview of what we're talking about for this neighborhood. We're excited in the Office of Sustainability because, as I said, we don't necessarily have experience with the lead for neighborhood development tool. So it'll be a good learning experience for city staff and hopefully we'll pick up some things through this process that will be applicable to neighborhoods across the city.

One of the things that we do in the Office of Sustainability is always looking for grant opportunities to pursue either for funding or, in this case, technical assistance. And so and this particular grant opportunity, the organization Global Green reached out to us and invited us to apply for a program that they're doing that's called the Sustainable Neighborhood Assessment. This is the third year of their program. In the past two years, they've selected in each of the years, seven or eight other cities around the country. This year they were looking for another seven or eight cities. And so Long Beach applied. We in working with the Development Services Department and looking into previous planning efforts, we selected a neighborhood in in the eighth District in the vicinity of Market Street and the Virginia Village right there at Market and Language Boulevard. And so what this is all about is we previously interacted with Global Green to create our green building policy for both municipal development and private development. And in that policy, we use a tool called the Lead Checklist LEED being leadership in energy and environmental design. So at this point in the city of Long Beach, we've got more than 30 LEED certified buildings, some of which are city owned facilities such as Fire Station 12 or the gas and oil building that was recently completed. There's a there's a different product that we're not as familiar with that's called LEED for Neighborhood Development. So over the course of this grant technical assistance, we will be doing a assessment of this neighborhood around Market Street with a mind to what sort of strengths the neighborhood has, what sort of green opportunities exist.

One of the things that we do in the Office of Sustainability is always looking for grant opportunities to pursue either for funding or, in this case, technical assistance. And so and this particular grant opportunity, the organization Global Green reached out to us and invited us to apply for a program that they're doing that's called the Sustainable Neighborhood Assessment. This is the third year of their program. In the past two years, they've selected in each of the years, seven or eight other cities around the country. This year they were looking for another seven or eight cities. And so Long Beach applied. We in working with the Development Services Department and looking into previous planning efforts, we selected a neighborhood in in the eighth District in the vicinity of Market Street and the Virginia Village right there at Market and Language Boulevard. And so what this is all about is we previously interacted with Global Green to create our green building policy for both municipal development and private development. And in that policy, we use a tool called the Lead Checklist LEED being leadership in energy and environmental design. So at this point in the city of Long Beach, we've got more than 30 LEED certified buildings, some of which are city owned facilities such as Fire Station 12 or the gas and oil building that was recently completed. There's a there's a different product that we're not as familiar with that's called LEED for Neighborhood Development. So over the course of this grant technical assistance, we will be doing a assessment of this neighborhood around Market Street with a mind to what sort of strengths the neighborhood has, what sort of green opportunities exist. And we will be provided with a report and assessment at the end of the process that will make recommendations to the city about how it might proceed with development projects in that neighborhood to introduce green elements such as pedestrian friendliness, stormwater improvements, open space linkages and so on. The technical assistance involves an intensive three day site visit by the Global Green Experts, where we'll do. A city team will be assembled to work with the Global Green team. We'll do a walk the neighborhood to get a feel for what's going on, on the ground, review the existing plans that have been completed for the area, run through the the lead for neighborhood development checklist to review opportunities there, hold a couple or a stakeholder meeting and also a an evening community input meeting and then tie all that information together in what I've seen done for the other cities that have completed this process, a 20 to 25 page report that then comes back to the city and it'll be on us to implement recommendations that are made in that report. So that's a kind of a quick overview of what we're talking about for this neighborhood. We're excited in the Office of Sustainability because, as I said, we don't necessarily have experience with the lead for neighborhood development tool. So it'll be a good learning experience for city staff and hopefully we'll pick up some things through this process that will be applicable to neighborhoods across the city. That's the end of my report and I'm ready for any questions.", "Speaker 5: Well, I'll just give you a comment and say, you know, I'm looking forward to this. I know many of our residents are looking forward to it. And as you say, stakeholders as well in the area. I think this project will this assessment will help tie in Virginia Village.

And in that policy, we use a tool called the Lead Checklist LEED being leadership in energy and environmental design. So at this point in the city of Long Beach, we've got more than 30 LEED certified buildings, some of which are city owned facilities such as Fire Station 12 or the gas and oil building that was recently completed. There's a there's a different product that we're not as familiar with that's called LEED for Neighborhood Development. So over the course of this grant technical assistance, we will be doing a assessment of this neighborhood around Market Street with a mind to what sort of strengths the neighborhood has, what sort of green opportunities exist. And we will be provided with a report and assessment at the end of the process that will make recommendations to the city about how it might proceed with development projects in that neighborhood to introduce green elements such as pedestrian friendliness, stormwater improvements, open space linkages and so on. The technical assistance involves an intensive three day site visit by the Global Green Experts, where we'll do. A city team will be assembled to work with the Global Green team. We'll do a walk the neighborhood to get a feel for what's going on, on the ground, review the existing plans that have been completed for the area, run through the the lead for neighborhood development checklist to review opportunities there, hold a couple or a stakeholder meeting and also a an evening community input meeting and then tie all that information together in what I've seen done for the other cities that have completed this process, a 20 to 25 page report that then comes back to the city and it'll be on us to implement recommendations that are made in that report. So that's a kind of a quick overview of what we're talking about for this neighborhood. We're excited in the Office of Sustainability because, as I said, we don't necessarily have experience with the lead for neighborhood development tool. So it'll be a good learning experience for city staff and hopefully we'll pick up some things through this process that will be applicable to neighborhoods across the city.

One of the things that we do in the Office of Sustainability is always looking for grant opportunities to pursue either for funding or, in this case, technical assistance. And so and this particular grant opportunity, the organization Global Green reached out to us and invited us to apply for a program that they're doing that's called the Sustainable Neighborhood Assessment. This is the third year of their program. In the past two years, they've selected in each of the years, seven or eight other cities around the country. This year they were looking for another seven or eight cities. And so Long Beach applied.

One of the things that we do in the Office of Sustainability is always looking for grant opportunities to pursue either for funding or, in this case, technical assistance. And so and this particular grant opportunity, the organization Global Green reached out to us and invited us to apply for a program that they're doing that's called the Sustainable Neighborhood Assessment. This is the third year of their program. In the past two years, they've selected in each of the years, seven or eight other cities around the country. This year they were looking for another seven or eight cities. And so Long Beach applied. We in working with the Development Services Department and looking into previous planning efforts, we selected a neighborhood in in the eighth District in the vicinity of Market Street and the Virginia Village right there at Market and Language Boulevard. And so what this is all about is we previously interacted with Global Green to create our green building policy for both municipal development and private development. And in that policy, we use a tool called the Lead Checklist LEED being leadership in energy and environmental design. So at this point in the city of Long Beach, we've got more than 30 LEED certified buildings, some of which are city owned facilities such as Fire Station 12 or the gas and oil building that was recently completed. There's a there's a different product that we're not as familiar with that's called LEED for Neighborhood Development. So over the course of this grant technical assistance, we will be doing a assessment of this neighborhood around Market Street with a mind to what sort of strengths the neighborhood has, what sort of green opportunities exist. And we will be provided with a report and assessment at the end of the process that will make recommendations to the city about how it might proceed with development projects in that neighborhood to introduce green elements such as pedestrian friendliness, stormwater improvements, open space linkages and so on. The technical assistance involves an intensive three day site visit by the Global Green Experts, where we'll do. A city team will be assembled to work with the Global Green team. We'll do a walk the neighborhood to get a feel for what's going on, on the ground, review the existing plans that have been completed for the area, run through the the lead for neighborhood development checklist to review opportunities there, hold a couple or a stakeholder meeting and also a an evening community input meeting and then tie all that information together in what I've seen done for the other cities that have completed this process, a 20 to 25 page report that then comes back to the city and it'll be on us to implement recommendations that are made in that report. So that's a kind of a quick overview of what we're talking about for this neighborhood. We're excited in the Office of Sustainability because, as I said, we don't necessarily have experience with the lead for neighborhood development tool. So it'll be a good learning experience for city staff and hopefully we'll pick up some things through this process that will be applicable to neighborhoods across the city. That's the end of my report and I'm ready for any questions.", "Speaker 5: Well, I'll just give you a comment and say, you know, I'm looking forward to this. I know many of our residents are looking forward to it. And as you say, stakeholders as well in the area. I think this project will this assessment will help tie in Virginia Village.

And we will be provided with a report and assessment at the end of the process that will make recommendations to the city about how it might proceed with development projects in that neighborhood to introduce green elements such as pedestrian friendliness, stormwater improvements, open space linkages and so on. The technical assistance involves an intensive three day site visit by the Global Green Experts, where we'll do. A city team will be assembled to work with the Global Green team. We'll do a walk the neighborhood to get a feel for what's going on, on the ground, review the existing plans that have been completed for the area, run through the the lead for neighborhood development checklist to review opportunities there, hold a couple or a stakeholder meeting and also a an evening community input meeting and then tie all that information together in what I've seen done for the other cities that have completed this process, a 20 to 25 page report that then comes back to the city and it'll be on us to implement recommendations that are made in that report. So that's a kind of a quick overview of what we're talking about for this neighborhood. We're excited in the Office of Sustainability because, as I said, we don't necessarily have experience with the lead for neighborhood development tool.

One of the things that we do in the Office of Sustainability is always looking for grant opportunities to pursue either for funding or, in this case, technical assistance. And so and this particular grant opportunity, the organization Global Green reached out to us and invited us to apply for a program that they're doing that's called the Sustainable Neighborhood Assessment. This is the third year of their program. In the past two years, they've selected in each of the years, seven or eight other cities around the country. This year they were looking for another seven or eight cities. And so Long Beach applied. We in working with the Development Services Department and looking into previous planning efforts, we selected a neighborhood in in the eighth District in the vicinity of Market Street and the Virginia Village right there at Market and Language Boulevard. And so what this is all about is we previously interacted with Global Green to create our green building policy for both municipal development and private development. And in that policy, we use a tool called the Lead Checklist LEED being leadership in energy and environmental design. So at this point in the city of Long Beach, we've got more than 30 LEED certified buildings, some of which are city owned facilities such as Fire Station 12 or the gas and oil building that was recently completed. There's a there's a different product that we're not as familiar with that's called LEED for Neighborhood Development.

One of them was the Cash and Associates, and one of them was the Moffatt and Nickel Report. And when I was president of the Nhia, they came to a meeting and they told people that we have walls that are deteriorating and we have to do something about them quickly. And they had an estimate that it would cost about 78 million to do the entire island. And with neighborhood volunteers, we came together and formed a seawall committee and about 20 people have consistently, once a month for 18 years every month, come together to provide input and to work with the city. And public works has been very receptive and responsive to our requests. And talking about these public seawalls, the city council is always provided us with continual funding during that time period to work on road repair. And there was a study done by the State Lands Commission and the city. There was a study prepared by transit systems and that particular one, the gentleman who was doing it, could even pull the wall pieces out by hand. So it was at that point it was in imminent danger of failure. And so six phases of a project were established at that time and moved ahead. Tetra Tech developed the phases in pieces and then the Coastal Commission looked at it. And through the help of Councilman DeLong and through continued help of our vice mayor here, he worked on the committee on the commission, the Coastal Commission, and helped to formulate the ways that we could get a project through that would be on the water side, because we were looking at the birds that nested the created creatures in the water.

One of them was the Cash and Associates, and one of them was the Moffatt and Nickel Report. And when I was president of the Nhia, they came to a meeting and they told people that we have walls that are deteriorating and we have to do something about them quickly. And they had an estimate that it would cost about 78 million to do the entire island. And with neighborhood volunteers, we came together and formed a seawall committee and about 20 people have consistently, once a month for 18 years every month, come together to provide input and to work with the city. And public works has been very receptive and responsive to our requests. And talking about these public seawalls, the city council is always provided us with continual funding during that time period to work on road repair. And there was a study done by the State Lands Commission and the city. There was a study prepared by transit systems and that particular one, the gentleman who was doing it, could even pull the wall pieces out by hand. So it was at that point it was in imminent danger of failure. And so six phases of a project were established at that time and moved ahead. Tetra Tech developed the phases in pieces and then the Coastal Commission looked at it. And through the help of Councilman DeLong and through continued help of our vice mayor here, he worked on the committee on the commission, the Coastal Commission, and helped to formulate the ways that we could get a project through that would be on the water side, because we were looking at the birds that nested the created creatures in the water. We looked at the public access and make sure that public access was being addressed. And so the plan that has been finally come up and it's taken more than eight years to pull it together, is now before you.

Since 1939, the present Naples sea walls have been standing and they've stood the test of time. But more than 18 years ago, the city had prudently paid attention to the cries from homeowners in the Naples Improvement Association, and they had done several studies. One of them was the Cash and Associates, and one of them was the Moffatt and Nickel Report. And when I was president of the Nhia, they came to a meeting and they told people that we have walls that are deteriorating and we have to do something about them quickly. And they had an estimate that it would cost about 78 million to do the entire island. And with neighborhood volunteers, we came together and formed a seawall committee and about 20 people have consistently, once a month for 18 years every month, come together to provide input and to work with the city. And public works has been very receptive and responsive to our requests. And talking about these public seawalls, the city council is always provided us with continual funding during that time period to work on road repair. And there was a study done by the State Lands Commission and the city. There was a study prepared by transit systems and that particular one, the gentleman who was doing it, could even pull the wall pieces out by hand. So it was at that point it was in imminent danger of failure. And so six phases of a project were established at that time and moved ahead. Tetra Tech developed the phases in pieces and then the Coastal Commission looked at it. And through the help of Councilman DeLong and through continued help of our vice mayor here, he worked on the committee on the commission, the Coastal Commission, and helped to formulate the ways that we could get a project through that would be on the water side, because we were looking at the birds that nested the created creatures in the water. We looked at the public access and make sure that public access was being addressed. And so the plan that has been finally come up and it's taken more than eight years to pull it together, is now before you.

Since 1939, the present Naples sea walls have been standing and they've stood the test of time. But more than 18 years ago, the city had prudently paid attention to the cries from homeowners in the Naples Improvement Association, and they had done several studies. One of them was the Cash and Associates, and one of them was the Moffatt and Nickel Report. And when I was president of the Nhia, they came to a meeting and they told people that we have walls that are deteriorating and we have to do something about them quickly. And they had an estimate that it would cost about 78 million to do the entire island. And with neighborhood volunteers, we came together and formed a seawall committee and about 20 people have consistently, once a month for 18 years every month, come together to provide input and to work with the city. And public works has been very receptive and responsive to our requests. And talking about these public seawalls, the city council is always provided us with continual funding during that time period to work on road repair. And there was a study done by the State Lands Commission and the city. There was a study prepared by transit systems and that particular one, the gentleman who was doing it, could even pull the wall pieces out by hand. So it was at that point it was in imminent danger of failure. And so six phases of a project were established at that time and moved ahead. Tetra Tech developed the phases in pieces and then the Coastal Commission looked at it. And through the help of Councilman DeLong and through continued help of our vice mayor here, he worked on the committee on the commission, the Coastal Commission, and helped to formulate the ways that we could get a project through that would be on the water side, because we were looking at the birds that nested the created creatures in the water. We looked at the public access and make sure that public access was being addressed. And so the plan that has been finally come up and it's taken more than eight years to pull it together, is now before you.

And they had an estimate that it would cost about 78 million to do the entire island. And with neighborhood volunteers, we came together and formed a seawall committee and about 20 people have consistently, once a month for 18 years every month, come together to provide input and to work with the city. And public works has been very receptive and responsive to our requests. And talking about these public seawalls, the city council is always provided us with continual funding during that time period to work on road repair.

Since 1939, the present Naples sea walls have been standing and they've stood the test of time. But more than 18 years ago, the city had prudently paid attention to the cries from homeowners in the Naples Improvement Association, and they had done several studies. One of them was the Cash and Associates, and one of them was the Moffatt and Nickel Report. And when I was president of the Nhia, they came to a meeting and they told people that we have walls that are deteriorating and we have to do something about them quickly. And they had an estimate that it would cost about 78 million to do the entire island. And with neighborhood volunteers, we came together and formed a seawall committee and about 20 people have consistently, once a month for 18 years every month, come together to provide input and to work with the city. And public works has been very receptive and responsive to our requests. And talking about these public seawalls, the city council is always provided us with continual funding during that time period to work on road repair. And there was a study done by the State Lands Commission and the city. There was a study prepared by transit systems and that particular one, the gentleman who was doing it, could even pull the wall pieces out by hand. So it was at that point it was in imminent danger of failure. And so six phases of a project were established at that time and moved ahead. Tetra Tech developed the phases in pieces and then the Coastal Commission looked at it. And through the help of Councilman DeLong and through continued help of our vice mayor here, he worked on the committee on the commission, the Coastal Commission, and helped to formulate the ways that we could get a project through that would be on the water side, because we were looking at the birds that nested the created creatures in the water. We looked at the public access and make sure that public access was being addressed. And so the plan that has been finally come up and it's taken more than eight years to pull it together, is now before you. And we know that we don't want to spend any more money on studies, and we know that this is a good use of the Thailande fund for public access to our waterways and the Coastal Commission blessed it.

Since 1939, the present Naples sea walls have been standing and they've stood the test of time. But more than 18 years ago, the city had prudently paid attention to the cries from homeowners in the Naples Improvement Association, and they had done several studies. One of them was the Cash and Associates, and one of them was the Moffatt and Nickel Report. And when I was president of the Nhia, they came to a meeting and they told people that we have walls that are deteriorating and we have to do something about them quickly. And they had an estimate that it would cost about 78 million to do the entire island. And with neighborhood volunteers, we came together and formed a seawall committee and about 20 people have consistently, once a month for 18 years every month, come together to provide input and to work with the city. And public works has been very receptive and responsive to our requests. And talking about these public seawalls, the city council is always provided us with continual funding during that time period to work on road repair. And there was a study done by the State Lands Commission and the city. There was a study prepared by transit systems and that particular one, the gentleman who was doing it, could even pull the wall pieces out by hand. So it was at that point it was in imminent danger of failure. And so six phases of a project were established at that time and moved ahead. Tetra Tech developed the phases in pieces and then the Coastal Commission looked at it. And through the help of Councilman DeLong and through continued help of our vice mayor here, he worked on the committee on the commission, the Coastal Commission, and helped to formulate the ways that we could get a project through that would be on the water side, because we were looking at the birds that nested the created creatures in the water. We looked at the public access and make sure that public access was being addressed. And so the plan that has been finally come up and it's taken more than eight years to pull it together, is now before you. And we know that we don't want to spend any more money on studies, and we know that this is a good use of the Thailande fund for public access to our waterways and the Coastal Commission blessed it.

Since 1939, the present Naples sea walls have been standing and they've stood the test of time. But more than 18 years ago, the city had prudently paid attention to the cries from homeowners in the Naples Improvement Association, and they had done several studies. One of them was the Cash and Associates, and one of them was the Moffatt and Nickel Report. And when I was president of the Nhia, they came to a meeting and they told people that we have walls that are deteriorating and we have to do something about them quickly. And they had an estimate that it would cost about 78 million to do the entire island. And with neighborhood volunteers, we came together and formed a seawall committee and about 20 people have consistently, once a month for 18 years every month, come together to provide input and to work with the city. And public works has been very receptive and responsive to our requests. And talking about these public seawalls, the city council is always provided us with continual funding during that time period to work on road repair. And there was a study done by the State Lands Commission and the city. There was a study prepared by transit systems and that particular one, the gentleman who was doing it, could even pull the wall pieces out by hand. So it was at that point it was in imminent danger of failure. And so six phases of a project were established at that time and moved ahead. Tetra Tech developed the phases in pieces and then the Coastal Commission looked at it. And through the help of Councilman DeLong and through continued help of our vice mayor here, he worked on the committee on the commission, the Coastal Commission, and helped to formulate the ways that we could get a project through that would be on the water side, because we were looking at the birds that nested the created creatures in the water. We looked at the public access and make sure that public access was being addressed. And so the plan that has been finally come up and it's taken more than eight years to pull it together, is now before you. And we know that we don't want to spend any more money on studies, and we know that this is a good use of the Thailande fund for public access to our waterways and the Coastal Commission blessed it.

Since 1939, the present Naples sea walls have been standing and they've stood the test of time. But more than 18 years ago, the city had prudently paid attention to the cries from homeowners in the Naples Improvement Association, and they had done several studies. One of them was the Cash and Associates, and one of them was the Moffatt and Nickel Report. And when I was president of the Nhia, they came to a meeting and they told people that we have walls that are deteriorating and we have to do something about them quickly. And they had an estimate that it would cost about 78 million to do the entire island. And with neighborhood volunteers, we came together and formed a seawall committee and about 20 people have consistently, once a month for 18 years every month, come together to provide input and to work with the city. And public works has been very receptive and responsive to our requests. And talking about these public seawalls, the city council is always provided us with continual funding during that time period to work on road repair. And there was a study done by the State Lands Commission and the city. There was a study prepared by transit systems and that particular one, the gentleman who was doing it, could even pull the wall pieces out by hand. So it was at that point it was in imminent danger of failure. And so six phases of a project were established at that time and moved ahead. Tetra Tech developed the phases in pieces and then the Coastal Commission looked at it. And through the help of Councilman DeLong and through continued help of our vice mayor here, he worked on the committee on the commission, the Coastal Commission, and helped to formulate the ways that we could get a project through that would be on the water side, because we were looking at the birds that nested the created creatures in the water. We looked at the public access and make sure that public access was being addressed. And so the plan that has been finally come up and it's taken more than eight years to pull it together, is now before you.

Remember, the guys came to they came to this country with $0 and were really poverty. They were living on food stamps. The mother had severe cancer and so forth. Fast forward to today that they signed it. Zuckerberg had the guy over to his house for lunch and they had been working on the deal for a few months into that, running up for that. They decided to sign the deal and they picked up the phone and they called their respective legal teams and said, meet us over here, will sign the paperwork. And the guy said, Listen, I've got a better place to sign that. And Zuckerberg said, Fine, here we go. They hopped in the car, went about 20, 20 minutes, 20 miles away, and it was a vacant building. And that was the only obstacle.", "Speaker 3: Is there any relevance to.", "Speaker 2: Yes, it's just a sweet thing to keep in mind.

He actually resigned a year ago in June. So we have been using outside planned check services for several years now. We are using these planned check services. We are incredibly busy at the permit center and the flexibility that we have by using planned check services outside, planned check services we can use from one to 10 to 15 plan checkers all at the same time to keep moving our projects through the system.

All bills introduced March 21st, 2016.", "Speaker 0: Thank you very much. So all three of these bills are basically giving the mayor the authority to implement a collective bargaining agreement between three different union bodies. All three of these agreements were established within the parameters established by the Seattle councils, the City Council's Labor Relations Committee. So the first one is an agreement between the public service and industrial employees. Local 1239. That agreement will last till the end of December 2018. And I should probably should have said that I am filling in for Councilmember Burgess in his absence on this legislation. That particular agreement with one, two, three nine affects up to 125 regular sitting employees and up to 225 active temporary employees. The second counts, Bill 118646 is between the city and the Teamsters local union. 117 And I think all of you are familiar with 117 and the agreement affects up to 15 regular city employees and up to 200 active temporary employees. Again, that agreement will last through the end of 12th December 2018. In the last bill, 118644 is between the city and the Washington State Council of County and City Employees f. S CME Local 21. And that agreement again last to the end of December 2018, and that affects up to 150 regular city employees. And contrary to some of the public testimony that you heard today, we believe that these these agreements are acceptable to the employees, that their ability to to unionize and be a strong member of their respective unions strengthens our entire city and is for the benefit of our workers who mean the most to us. And so the certainly we recommend approval of these three agreements, which are all consistent with the parameters set by the Council's Labor Relations Committee. I move to pass in Lester.

There's been a lot of talk about the renter's commissioner and whether we need the renters commissioner or don't need the renters commission. Some have suggested that this is an anti landlord move. That's certainly not the case. We just want to give renters a formal voice here at City Hall. And as I said last week in discussing this, renters need landlords and landlords need renters.

This item is a public hearing to consider a resolution to modify the city's master fee schedule for development services by reducing selected entitlement fees and adopting new fees related to the mailing of public hearing notices. As you recall, on September 18th, 2018, the City Council adopted an ordinance that amended various sections of the zoning code related to conditional use permits, and it also. This action that the Council took at that time also updated the public notification requirements. Since then, our staff has evaluated the specific entitlement application fees, which currently include the cost for mailed public hearing notices. So of what we found from that analysis is that approximately $950 of the current application fees go toward the costs of producing and mailing these public notices. So adoption of this resolution would effectively unbundle the noticing fees from the application fee for most of the entitlement applications that we process. This resolution would also establish a tiered fee structure for mailing public notices going forward. The proposed fee reduction is $950 less than the current application fees and the new publication or the new public noticing fees range from $410 for the standard 300 foot noticing radius for Tier one. And this is explained in a little bit more detail in your staff report. But there's also a Tier two noticing four or 500 foot radius, and that is whenever a project is within 300 feet of a residential development and it goes up to Tier three, which is $950 for noticing whenever a project is 750 feet or greater from any application that addresses either a reduction of parking, shared parking or a project where there is a code requirement for some kind of distance buffering, like in a tattoo parlor as an example. So I just want to make sure that you're aware that this particular action will address mail notices, but it does not change any of the other standard notices that staff provides, and these include posting the notices in City Hall. We also post individual development sites with those large noticing posters. We also notice post notice on the city's website. We also notify city council offices as well as neighborhood organizations for all of the required public noticing for discretionary approvals. So I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of that. And we feel that the proposed resolution tonight balances the direction of the council to reduce the costs of the conditional use permit process. But we think that it also provides ample notification to the to the public for discretionary actions. So staff recommends that the city council adopt the proposed resolution to reduce the application fees and also to establish the new tiered fee schedule for public noticing.

This item is a public hearing to consider a resolution to modify the city's master fee schedule for development services by reducing selected entitlement fees and adopting new fees related to the mailing of public hearing notices. As you recall, on September 18th, 2018, the City Council adopted an ordinance that amended various sections of the zoning code related to conditional use permits, and it also. This action that the Council took at that time also updated the public notification requirements. Since then, our staff has evaluated the specific entitlement application fees, which currently include the cost for mailed public hearing notices. So of what we found from that analysis is that approximately $950 of the current application fees go toward the costs of producing and mailing these public notices. So adoption of this resolution would effectively unbundle the noticing fees from the application fee for most of the entitlement applications that we process. This resolution would also establish a tiered fee structure for mailing public notices going forward. The proposed fee reduction is $950 less than the current application fees and the new publication or the new public noticing fees range from $410 for the standard 300 foot noticing radius for Tier one. And this is explained in a little bit more detail in your staff report. But there's also a Tier two noticing four or 500 foot radius, and that is whenever a project is within 300 feet of a residential development and it goes up to Tier three, which is $950 for noticing whenever a project is 750 feet or greater from any application that addresses either a reduction of parking, shared parking or a project where there is a code requirement for some kind of distance buffering, like in a tattoo parlor as an example. So I just want to make sure that you're aware that this particular action will address mail notices, but it does not change any of the other standard notices that staff provides, and these include posting the notices in City Hall. We also post individual development sites with those large noticing posters. We also notice post notice on the city's website. We also notify city council offices as well as neighborhood organizations for all of the required public noticing for discretionary approvals. So I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of that. And we feel that the proposed resolution tonight balances the direction of the council to reduce the costs of the conditional use permit process. But we think that it also provides ample notification to the to the public for discretionary actions. So staff recommends that the city council adopt the proposed resolution to reduce the application fees and also to establish the new tiered fee schedule for public noticing.

As you recall, on September 18th, 2018, the City Council adopted an ordinance that amended various sections of the zoning code related to conditional use permits, and it also. This action that the Council took at that time also updated the public notification requirements. Since then, our staff has evaluated the specific entitlement application fees, which currently include the cost for mailed public hearing notices. So of what we found from that analysis is that approximately $950 of the current application fees go toward the costs of producing and mailing these public notices. So adoption of this resolution would effectively unbundle the noticing fees from the application fee for most of the entitlement applications that we process. This resolution would also establish a tiered fee structure for mailing public notices going forward. The proposed fee reduction is $950 less than the current application fees and the new publication or the new public noticing fees range from $410 for the standard 300 foot noticing radius for Tier one. And this is explained in a little bit more detail in your staff report. But there's also a Tier two noticing four or 500 foot radius, and that is whenever a project is within 300 feet of a residential development and it goes up to Tier three, which is $950 for noticing whenever a project is 750 feet or greater from any application that addresses either a reduction of parking, shared parking or a project where there is a code requirement for some kind of distance buffering, like in a tattoo parlor as an example. So I just want to make sure that you're aware that this particular action will address mail notices, but it does not change any of the other standard notices that staff provides, and these include posting the notices in City Hall. We also post individual development sites with those large noticing posters. We also notice post notice on the city's website. We also notify city council offices as well as neighborhood organizations for all of the required public noticing for discretionary approvals. So I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of that. And we feel that the proposed resolution tonight balances the direction of the council to reduce the costs of the conditional use permit process. But we think that it also provides ample notification to the to the public for discretionary actions. So staff recommends that the city council adopt the proposed resolution to reduce the application fees and also to establish the new tiered fee schedule for public noticing. That concludes the presentation. But I'm here as well as Lisa Falls, our Administrative Services Bureau manager, who assisted on this project.
